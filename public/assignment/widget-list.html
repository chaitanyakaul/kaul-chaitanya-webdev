    WASHINGTON — President Trump planned to formally abandon the Trans-Pacific Partnership on Monday, pulling away from Asia and scrapping his predecessor’s most significant trade deal on his first full weekday in office, administration officials said.

    Mr. Trump sharply criticized the partnership agreement during last year’s campaign, calling
    it a bad deal for American workers. Although the deal had not been approved by Congress, the decision
    to withdraw the American signature at the start of Mr. Trump’s administration is a signal that he plans
    to follow through on promises to take a more aggressive stance against foreign competitors
